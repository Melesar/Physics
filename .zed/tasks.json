    // * `always` — always show the task's pane, and focus the corresponding tab in it (default)
    // * `no_focus` — always show the task's pane, add the task's tab in it, but don't focus it
    // * `never` — do not alter focus, but still add/reuse the task's tab in its pane

    // * `never` — Do nothing when the command finishes (default)
    // * `always` — always hide the terminal tab, hide the pane also if it was the last tab in it
    // * `on_success` — hide the terminal tab on task success only, otherwise behaves similar to `always`
